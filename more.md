* absentie - giving back to my kids' school (never given though)
* doctool - predecessor of myprojects
* magiokis - back in the days I read that dynamic websites were better
* magiokis-php - I just had to try it out 
* magiokis-cherry - and then quickly back to Python
* magiokis-django - another framework to try to master
* logviewer-php - I thought it would be easier this way
