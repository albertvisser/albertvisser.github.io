## Welcome to my world

Let's be honest: I'm a Python fan and a BitBucket refugee. That is, I've been using Mercurial for my personal projects but apparently Git is the future so I can't use BB anymore, might as well move to where everybody seems to be going so now I'm learning Git. Also I much prefer Restuctured Text over Markdown for writing docs but hey, I'll move with the times. I may be a dinosaur but I'll decide myself when it's time to die out thank you very much.

So I'm in the process of moving my repositories from there to here and also the docs pages I used to maintain with my own website generator (which will also be included here).
