## Welcome to my world

Hi, I'm Albert Visser from Holland and I'm a programmer like other people are gamers (it's also what I do for a living, but that's a different world). 

These pages are about a collection of my personal software projects. Some of them are tools I built to make my programming life easier, others are stuff I made to demonstrate / prove a point or to try out things.

Let's be honest: I'm a Python fan and a BitBucket refugee. That is, I've been using Mercurial for my personal projects but apparently Git is the future so I can't use BB anymore, might as well move to where everybody seems to be going so now I'm learning Git. Also I much prefer Restuctured Text over Markdown for writing docs but hey, I'll move with the times. I may be a dinosaur but I'll decide myself when it's time to die out thank you very much.

So I'm in the process of moving my repositories from there to here and also the docs pages I used to maintain with my own website generator (which will also be included here).
