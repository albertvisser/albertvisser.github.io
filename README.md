## Welcome to my world

Hi, I'm Albert Visser from Holland and I'm a programmer like other people are gamers (it's also what I used to do for a living, but that's a different world). 

I'm from 1956, I started in IT in 1987 and I'm hooked on Python from around 2002.

These pages are about a collection of my personal software projects. Some of them are tools I built to make my programming life easier, others are stuff I made to demonstrate / prove a point or to try out things.

It's mainly meant as a personal archive stored outside of my home, but also a bit about public exposure - being able to show others what I do. My development process however takes place entirely at home, and the ticket numbers that the commits may refer to exist only in the Trac installation on my laptop. There are no plans to move that here as well.
