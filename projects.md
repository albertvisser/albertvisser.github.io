## Projects on this site

This is only a summation. More elaborate docs are here: https://www.magiokis.nl/docs/en/

* LinterGui, a frontend for Python Linters (because I'm too lazy to call them from the command line)
* FileFindr, a tool to Find and Replace in File (because SciTE didn't do the latter)
* LogViewer, a tiny webapp to view server logs in the browser (seemed like a good idea at the time)
* Albums, my latest rewrite of a record collection managing app
* albumsgui, a nonweb version of this 
* Actiereg, a rewrite of an old issue tracking app
* Axe, my take on an XML editor
* Ashe, my take on an HTML editor
* CSSEdit, my take on a CSS editor, in the same vein as the previous two
* a-propos, a productivity helper I wrote for work where I can't use it anymore
* notetree, a-propos but in a tree interface and with keywords
* treedocs, rich text notes/docs in a tree interface, with multiple hierarchies
* compare-tool, for out-of-sequence comparisons of settings, xml and plain text
* hotkeys, keep track of useful keycombos for all your applications
* rst2html, maintaining web pages in your browser using ReST
