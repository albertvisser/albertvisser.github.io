## Projects on this site

In due time, these will be links to detail pages. For now, it's only a summation.

* LinterGui, a frontend for Python Linters (because I'm too lazy to call the from the command line)
* FileFindr, a tool to Find and Replace in File (because SciTE didn't do the latter)
* LogViewer, a tiny webapp to view server logs in the browser
